# Smart Water Quality Monitoring System

## Features 🚀  
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks water quality parameters like pH, TDS, and temperature in real-time.  
- **IoT Connectivity**: Utilizes ESP32 to send data to the cloud for seamless monitoring.  
- **Mobile App Integration**: Visualizes water quality data on a user-friendly mobile app for instant analysis.  

## Components Used 🛠️  
- **ESP32**: Microcontroller for reading sensor data and transmitting it to the cloud and app.  
- **pH Sensor**: Measures the acidity or alkalinity of the water.  
- **TDS Sensor**: Monitors the concentration of dissolved solids in the water.  
- **Temperature Sensor**: Tracks the water temperature to ensure environmental suitability.  
- **Mobile App (Flutter)**: Provides a user-friendly interface for real-time data monitoring and analysis.  
- **Firebase**: Cloud platform used to store sensor data and facilitate communication with the app.  

## How It Works 🖥️  
1. **Sensors**: Collect water quality data in real-time, including pH, TDS, and temperature.  
2. **ESP32 Microcontroller**: Processes the sensor data and transmits it to Firebase.  
3. **Cloud Storage**: Firebase stores the data and makes it accessible to the Flutter app.  
4. **Mobile App**: Displays real-time and historical data, helping users analyze water quality trends and take action when required.  

## Applications 🌟  
- **Domestic Water Quality Monitoring**: Ensures clean and safe drinking water.  
- **Aquaculture**: Maintains optimal water conditions for fish and other aquatic organisms.  
- **Industrial Use**: Monitors water quality in manufacturing processes.  
- **Agriculture**: Tracks water parameters to ensure crop health and soil suitability.  
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Assists in research and conservation by monitoring water bodies.  

## Getting Started 🛠️  
### Hardware Setup 🧑‍🔧  
- Connect the **ESP32** with **pH**, **TDS**, and **Temperature sensors**.  
- Ensure the ESP32 is powered via USB or an appropriate power source.  

### Software Configuration 💻  
- Set up **Firebase** to store sensor data.  
- Integrate the **Flutter app** with Firebase for real-time data access.  

### Deployment 🚀  
- Flash the **ESP32** with the firmware using Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.  
- Run the mobile app on your device to start monitoring water quality.  

## Future Scope 🌐  
- Addition of more sensors (e.g., **Turbidity**, **Conductivity**) for comprehensive monitoring.  
- Advanced **analytics** for water quality prediction and trend analysis.  
- Integration with **AI** for automated anomaly detection and predictive maintenance.
